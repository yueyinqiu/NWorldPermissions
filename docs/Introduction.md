> **CAUTION!** There is just a brief introduction, you may get more on [WIKI(GITHUB)](https://github.com/yueyinqiu/NWorldPermissions/wiki), especially [the Offline Players Tracker page](https://github.com/yueyinqiu/NWorldPermissions/wiki/Offline-Players-Tracker), otherwise you may misuse some features.

The main function of this plugin is to designate certain worlds as controlled worlds, which will not be accessible unless one have corresponding permissions.  
If you are trying to teleport to a controlled world, you will receive a message: ![](https://i.postimg.cc/DfNc0b00/image.png)  
And if you have a permission "nworldpermissions.forfreeto.<world_name>": ![](https://i.postimg.cc/gcxTgp6w/image-1.png)  
The messages are customizable. And this plugin provides the ability to teleport the players (including the offline ones) out of a world.

By using this plugin, you can solve those problems: 
- After a world is reset, and I'd like the builders going to build something first, how to temporarily prevent players from entering?
- When a world is going to be reset, how to teleport out the players in that world?
- How can I create a "VIP world"?
- And more... (visit [Use Cases](https://github.com/yueyinqiu/NWorldPermissions/wiki/Use-Cases) to get the use cases)
But if you just want a resource world, the plugin ['Resource World'](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/75994) is more recommended. (you can also use both to achieve more functions)
