In the latest version, issuing '/wp' can get all, so I'm not willing to put it here.

The only permissions you can't find in the hints is 'nworldpermissions.forfreeto.<world_name>'. It will give a player the access to a controlled world.

If you still don't know how to use the plugin, follow [Availability Check](https://github.com/yueyinqiu/NWorldPermissions/wiki/Availability-Check).

> In previous versions, the permissions might be: 'nworldpermissions.toworld.<world_name>', 'nworldpermissions.reload' or 'nworldpermissions.admin'.
