      ====
      Well, {senderName}. Here's the help, but the first page.
      Use '/nworldpermissions help <page_index>' to get more, and there are totally 6 pages including this one.
    - |
      ====
      Well, {senderName}. The second page.
      You should write the file 'config.yml' to make some worlds controlled,
      then restart your server or run the command '/nworldpermissions reload'.
    - |
      ====
      Well, {senderName}. The third page.
      Now the players will find that they can't get into the worlds, but the players have been in the worlds will still there.
      You can use the command '/nworldpermissions tphere <world_name>' to teleport all the online players who are in the specific world to you.
    #  You can also use the command '/nworldpermissions setlocationhere <worldname>' to make the offline players here.
    - |
      ====
      Well, {senderName}. The fourth page.
      Now all the players are completely isolated from the controlled worlds.
      You can give some of them the permission 'nworldpermissions.forfreeto.<world_name>' to allow them enter the specific world.
    - |
      ====
      Ok, {senderName}. The fifth page.
      I think you've found the point. The offline players will still in those worlds.
      You should set 'enable-offline-controller' to true. And now the players will be tracked.
      When a player leave the server, here will be a record, you can use command '/nworldpermissions setofflinehere <world_name>' to change the record to where you are standing,
      then the players will be teleported here next time.
      But it needs the player join and leave the server when 'enable-offline-controller' is true.

      Congratulations, {senderName}!
      You've successfully made the full use of the plugin.
      There aren't anything more to tell you except that you can just use 'wp', 'wdpr', 'worldpermissions' to run all the commands.
  # This will be displayed when you use the command '/worldpermissions help'. Adding and removing pages is accepted.
  # {senderName} : Name of the command sender.
