      &r&d====
      &r&3Well, {senderName}&r&3. Here's the help, but the first page.
      &r&bUse '/nworldpermissions help <page_index>' to get more, and there are totally 6 pages including this one.
    - |
      &r&d====
      &r&3Well, {senderName}&r&3. The second page.
      &r&bYou should write the file 'config.yml' to make some worlds controlled, then restart your server or run the command '/nworldpermissions reload'.
    - |
      &r&d====
      &r&3Well, {senderName}&r&3. The third page.
      &r&bNow the players will find that they can't get into the worlds, but the players have been in the worlds will still there.
      &r&3You can use the command '/nworldpermissions tphere <world_name>' to teleport the online players in the specific world to you.
    - |
      &r&d====
      &r&3Well, {senderName}&r&3. The fourth page.
      &r&bNow all the players are completely isolated from the controlled worlds.
      &r&3You can give some of them the permission 'nworldpermissions.forfreeto.<world_name>' to allow them enter the specific world.
    - |
      &r&d====
      &r&3Ok, {senderName}&r&3. The fifth page.
      &r&bI think you've found the point. The offline players will still in those worlds.
      &r&3You should set 'enable-offline-controller' to true. And now the players will be tracked.
      &r&bWhen a player leave the server, here will be a record, you can use command '/nworldpermissions setofflinehere <world_name>' to change the records to where you are standing, then the players will be teleported here next time.
      &r&3Watch oust! it needs the player join and leave the server when 'enable-offline-controller' is true.
